# How to code a Transformer model for time series forecasting in PyTorch
This project utilizes two datasets, Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96, for time series forecasting using a Transformer model.

The train.py shows how to train the transformer.

The psd.py is used to compares the ground truth and generated data using Power Spectral Density (PSD).

The lorenzinf.py is used to performs inference on the trained model and generates plots.

ðŸš€ Usage: Run train.py to train the model, then use lorenzinf.py for predictions and visualization. Finally, use psd.py to evaluate performance.
